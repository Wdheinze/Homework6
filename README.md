# Homework6
After working hard on this program and getting almost everything to work I felt hopeful. I quite enjoyed this project but once I uploaded it onto github everything broke.
It works perfectly fine in my actual folder but when it is on github it just breaks. I don't get what happened or how this happened. My counter was working but of course 
github isnt showing that it is or that anything is working. I dont know if it is my internet and if it works on other computers but if it does then ill be happy.
Overall this was a fun project. I am sad that I was not able to get the part of getting the final page to work but I enjoyed making the attempt counter and seeing it actually work.
